### Clone the Repository
**First, you need to clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine.**

- Run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ej1Tech/rimtech.git
   ```
   
### Navigate to the Project Directory
Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the project directory:
- Run :
```bash
cd rimtech
```

### Install Dependencies
- Run:

```bash
npm install
```

- Or, if you're using Yarn run:

```bash
yarn install
```
### Make Your Changes
You can now open the project in your code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) and make the necessary changes.
- Run :
```bash
code .
```

This command opens the current directory in VS Code.

### Pull the Latest Changes
- Run :
```bash
git pull origin <branch-name>
```
Replace `<branch-name>` with the branch you want to pull the changes from, usually `main` or `master`.

### Start the Development Server
- Run :
```bash
npm run dev
```
Or, if you're using Yarn :
- Run :
```bash
yarn dev
```
This will start a local server, and you can view your project in the browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Commit and Push Your Changes
After making changes, you can commit and push them back to the GitHub repository:
- Run :
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin <branch-name>
```

Replace `<branch-name>` with the appropriate branch.
